# GiveMeSomeCredit

Can we look at a candidate application and tell if they are going to pay back their loans on time with reasonable accuracy?

Yes.

This dataset comes from a 2011 Kaggle competiton. Here is the competition overview:

"Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit.

Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. This competition requires participants to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

The goal of this competition is to build a model that (lenders) can use to help make the best financial decisions."

Top scores on the leaderboard were roughly .86. My best gradient boosting classifier matched that with a score of .868.
